# nHapi
NHapi is a .NET port of the original Java project [HAPI](http://hl7api.sourceforge.net/).

NHapi allows Microsoft .NET developers to easily use an HL7 2.x object model. This object model allows for parsing and encoding HL7 2.x data to/from Pipe Delimited or XML formats. A very handy program for use in the health care industry.

This project is **NOT** affiliated with the HL7 organization. This software just conforms to the HL7 2.x specifications.

**Key Benefits**

- Easy object model  
- Microsoft .NET 3.5 library that conforms to HL7 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.3.1, 2.4, 2.5, 2.5.1, 2.6, 2.7, 2.7.1, 2.8 and 2.8.1 specifications  
- Can take a pipe delimited or XML formatted HL7 2.x message and build the C# object model for use in code  
- Can take the C# HL7 object model and produce pipe delimited or XML formatted HL7  
- FREE! (You can't beat that price) and open source  
- Fast
